# WeCode NI

The Next.js powered UI for WeCode NI!

---

This project is no longer running. The code in this repo originally powered the WeCode NI website, a community driven job board for tech jobs in Northern Ireland. The project was built using Next.js and was hosted on Vercel. The database was conntected to using Prisma and the data was stored in a MySQL database in PlanetScale.

As the project is no longer running, I have decided to make the codebase public. If you have any questions about the project, feel free to reach out to me by email at [hello@paulmcbride.com](mailto:hello@paulmcbride.com).
There are lots of things I would do differently if I were to start this project again, so please don't take this as an example of best practice. I have learned a lot since building this project and I would do things differently now.

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own projects, but please do not use the WeCode NI branding or logo.
